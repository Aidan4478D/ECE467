## first project notes

- gotta use one of the methods we talked about in class
- there's gonna be three test sets or training sets?
    - three different categories
    - one has test and training, two & three has just training
    - cant look at test set and put in a hard coded rule

- are allowed to hard code the three sets of categories
    - look at first label and know what categories there in it's fine
    - can tune hyperparameters to do well on test set
- if doing tf idf calculate vectors on our own
- if doing naive bayes you do the prob estimages
- draw out the contigency tables

- give me training documents
- give me text sets
- output has documents with their categories
- wants a small write up, what OS, which libraries, how did we tokenize

- he will look at overall accuracy and average all three accuracies to get overall system score
- corpus 1 high 80s
- corpus 3 up to 92
- naive bayes around 86-88 on corpus 2 (low 80s is still fine)
